# Contributing Guide

**When and what you can contribute?**  
* If you see that any code you can improve the efficiency, time complexity, space complexity, readability, clean coding etc.  
* If you are good at any programming language, basic data structures and algorithms and you realize that solutions are missing in your programming language.  
* If you find that anything wrong.  
  
**How to contribute?**  
I guess that you know the basic contribution rules. Although I have given bellow some of these.  
* Look through Issues tab above. Find if anybody created an issue same as you thinking.  
* Look through pull requests tab above. Find if anybody created a pull request same as you thinking.  
* If you see they are present, read those and you can also join to comment. If owner of this repo is agree with you then only go for contribution.  

Now if you are ready to contribute then follow these steps;  
* Clone the repo in your local computer.
* Create a related branch or check that branch if that present.  
* Make change and test (remember the line, no code is good without testing). For learning purpose testing will be manual, in your notebook.  
* Push that branch.  
* If your contribution has chosen then owner will merge it with main branch.    

Thank You. and Good Luck.
